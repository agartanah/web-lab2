The project structure contains three modules:

  The first is Data. It stores methods for interacting with local storage.

  The second is the View (Builders). This is where the methods for creating and customizing DOM elements are located.

  And finally the main script.js file. It links data and views, uses their methods, stores basic containers and modal windows. This is also where the functions for DOM element listeners are written
